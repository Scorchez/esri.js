# Javascript API Example Code

This repo holds a series of javascript based mapping example applications that show the JS API from Esri. The examples here are meant to simply demonstrate the capability of the API and show off some of lesser known features. 

Also the goal of this repository is share code in an efficient and collaborative way. Please feel free to fork and issue pull requests back with your examples. 

You can access the API here: http://serverapi.arcgisonline.com/jsapi/arcgis/?v=3.0compact
